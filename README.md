#### A preliminary version of a partition sum calculator for pore sieving problems

Christian Binder, Johannes Krondorfer, and Andreas W. Hauser

This is an ongoing project implementing an efficient way of calculating partition sums as they are needed for the calculation of reaction rates and selectivities for membranes.

It should be applicable to any calculator, e.g. DFT, force-field or tight binding methods.
